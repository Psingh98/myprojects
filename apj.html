                <li>
                      <p>Savitribai Phule was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra.
                 Along with her husband, in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India.</p>
                </li>

                <li>She was born in 3 january 1831 in Naigoan. Her parents name was LaxmiBai and khandoji Navse patil</li>
                <li>At the time of her marriage Savitribai was an illiterate.Jyotirao educated Savitribai at their home Jyotiba, amid working in farm use to
                     teach Savitribai and Sagunabai Shirsagar.</li>
  <li> After completing her primary education with Jyotirao, her further education was the responsibility of his friends, Sakharam Yeshwant Paranjpe and Keshav Shivram Bhavalkar.</li>

  <li>She also enrolled herself in two teacher's training programs. The first was at institution run by an American missionary, Cynthia Farrar, in Ahmednagar. The second course was at a Normal School in Pune.
       Given her training, Savitribai may have been the first Indian woman teacher and headmistress.</li>

       <li>After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada in Pune. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar. Sagunabai
            was Jyotiba Phule's sister, maternal aunt's daughter.[14] [1]who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.</li>
<li>In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts. They were entitled: the 
    Native Female School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, and Etceteras. These two trusts ended up encompassing many schools which were led by Savitribai Phule and later, Fatima Sheikh</li>

<li>Together with her husband, she taught children from different castes and had opened a total of 18 schools. The couple also opened a care centre called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha (literally,
     "Child-killing Prohibition Home") for pregnant rape victims and helped deliver and save their children.</li>
<li>Savitribai died a heroic death trying to save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad. </li>
         </ul>

<h6 class="bg-warning text-light chotu ">Jyotirao summarises Savitribai and his work in an interview given to the Christian missionary periodical, Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853, saying,</h6>

    <p class="container1"><em>"It did occur to me that the improvement that comes about in a child due to the mother is very important and good. So thosewho are concerned with the happiness and welfare of this country should definitely pay attention to the condition of women  and make every effort to impart knowledge to them if they want the country to progress. With this thought I started the school for girls first. But my caste brethren did not like that I was educating girls and my own father threw us 
    out of the house. Nobody was ready to give space for the school nor did we have money to build it. People were not willing to send their 
   children to school but Lahuji Ragh Raut Mang and Ranba Mahar convinced their caste brethren
   about the benefits of getting educated"</em></p>
